# CRUD Operations on Register Table - Frontend Implementation

This repository contains the frontend implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Register Table. The task was part of the screening process for the Software Developer-Intern role at INI8 LABS.

## Task Description
The task involved implementing CRUD operations on a Register Table. The frontend was required to be language-agnostic and framework-agnostic, allowing candidates to choose the programming language and framework they are most comfortable with.

## Implementation Details
I have successfully completed the frontend part of the task, which includes:
- Implementing a user interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries in the Register Table.
- Using Html and css for the frontend development.

## Next Steps
I regret to inform you that I have not been able to complete the backend portion of the task. I understand the importance of completing the entire task as per the guidelines provided. If given the opportunity, I am more than willing to complete the backend portion of the task within the given deadline.

## How to Run
